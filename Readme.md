## **Discharge Data collection** <a name="paragraph2"></a>


### Download Schedule <a name="subparagraph13"></a>
This is a sub paragraph, formatted in heading 3 style

### Transect SOPs <a name="subparagraph14"></a>

#### Equipment 
+ Flow Meter 

+ Meter Stick
+ Measuring Tape 
+ Depth Chart
+ Data book Pencil
+ Waders




#### Selecting a transect Site 

Transect site should be in a free flowing run, straight with uniform unobstructed flow.
There should not be any side channels, so that all the water flows through the main channel. 
Avoid pools, do not select areas where there is excess woody debris or large boulders. These characteristics can disturb flow creating turbulence, eddies and slack water. Be conscious of how the flow is affected by tributaries and if you want that include tributary discharge in your measurement. 

#### Stream Channel Reference Sites
The purpose of this section is to establish a permanent, benchmark reference site.



#### Recording Discharge Measurements
rewriting for flow tracker

1. Tighten a measuring tape across the stream at right angles to the flow. It should be taut and not sag in the middle.
2. Measure the total stream width and record this measurement. 
3. The standard method is to divide the width by 20, This will be done for brooks such as West Brook and Roaring Brook. Tribs  such as Mitchell, Obear and West Whatley will be measured every 10cm.
4. Place Meter ( Rod held vertical, Meter directed into flow) at first measuring point. Always stand downstream of tape and measurement.
5. Record the distance to the bank. Measure total stream depth and record this depth. If the stream Is less than 2.5 ft/.76m we will take the V measurement at .6 depth, deeper than 2.5ft/.76 the V measurement will be taken at .2 and .8 of depth [(Discharge Measurement Heights.xlsx)](https://github.com/tdube2014/Discharge/blob/master/Data/Discharge%20Measurement%20Heights.xlsx). Repeat until you have completed transect. (It is common to record three measurements at each point and then take the average.)

## **Flow Cam Discharge Data collection** <a name="paragraph3"></a>

####  Flow Cam Introduction

<img src="https://github.com/tdube2014/Discharge/blob/master/Equipment%20Info/Flow%20Cam/Images/119876C_1.jpg" width="150" height="150" />



We are exploring the usefulness of digital photos as a affordable method of assessing stream flow.  In streams where we have generated a accurate stage discharge relationship we can create a digital library of staff gauge height that can be used to accurately calculate flow. Cameras that range from $70 could be a useful method of data collection in contrast to $300 dollar and up level loggers.  Thus allowing form collection of data in more stream locations.



#### Methods

+ Establish a location for discharge data collection as described in Discharge Data Collection SOPs

+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of satff gauge height.

+ Generate a staff discharge rating curve

+ Collect digital Photos 

## **Flow Cam: Time Lapse Discharge Data Collection** <a name="paragraph4"></a>

#### Time lapse Introduction

With the advances in machine learning we are exploring the possibilities of using time lapse photos to calculate flow levels. Time lapse photos may be a cost effective way to collect stream flow data. Not only could this be a usefully tool for scientists this may be a great way for citizen scientists to become involved with the collection of stream flow data and advance the knowledge of our watersheds.

#### objectives

Investigate the number and quality of photos needed to make it possible teach a cpu (train an algorithm) to calculate flow from a series of photos
 
Examining low cost camera options for digital photo collection
Game Cameras
Cell Phone Cameras
Raspberry Pi Zero v1.3 camera
