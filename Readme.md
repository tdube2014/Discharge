#### Peg Test 
The purpose of the peg test is to determine the collimation error of a level instrument.


Prior to using the surveyors level, it must be tested for accuracy.  Assessing the performance of the level is very important. The main error is where the line of sight is not parallel to the horizontal line of collimation. This test will be performed at the beginning and the end to ensure that the instrument is working properly. Performed additional tests if you feel that instrument may have been bumped, jarred or not functioning properly.

Pick a relatively level area approximately 150 feet long. Initial setup is conducted by establishing four points of measurement (Peg A, Peg B, Peg C and Peg D) at the distances illustrated in figure one. Once the pegs have been installed proceed to setup surveyors’ level at Peg C. You may determine the elevation of the level that is convenient for the site chosen. This will be level height A.



<br>
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Peg Test Images/Peg Test Fig 1.png" title="Peg Test Fig 1">
</p>

Place a level rod on Peg D. Shoot the elevation from Peg C to Peg D (near elevation). Record elevation and distance **(Figure 2a)**. Rotate level 180 degrees, move level rod to Peg A and shoot elevation from Peg C to Peg A (far elevation). Record elevation and distance. **(Figure 2b)** Do not move level rod form Peg A.

At this point, while keeping your level rod on Peg A, move the surveyor’s level to Peg B. Adjust the elevation of the surveyors level up, Level the instrument. This will be level height B.  Shoot the elevation from Peg B to Peg A. Record elevation and distance **(Figure 3a)**. Rotate level 180 degrees, move level rod to Peg D and shoot elevation from Peg B to Peg D. Record elevation and distance **(Figure 3b)**.

Take the data recorded and input into SVmobile Station Levels Collimation Test. Calculate collimation error. If the error is outside of allowable tolerances redo test. If instrument continues to fail, calibrate or contact service technician. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Gauge Pool and Reference Sites

The purpose of this section is to establish permanent reference sites.

**1** 
<br>
First select a gauge pool with good control and install pad with pressure transducer.

<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Levels/1 Levels Guge Pool.png">
</p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>


**2** Select reference marks (RM) starting with RM1 being the master reference mark. RM1 should be a mark outside the high-water line and unlikely to move. This will be the mark from witch you can rebuild the guage pool if pad or reference points are disturbed.

<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Levels/2 Levels RM.png">
</p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>

 **3**
Select reference points to record water levels (tape-downs). You should have RPs to cover a high to low flow water levels. These points will also be referred to as your OG (outside gauge) points. Install wedge bolt anchors at each of these locations. Your pad with pressure transducer mounted to it will also have RPs. The transducer is referred to as your IG (inside gauge) point.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Levels/2 Levels RM.png">
</p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>

**4**
Select a location to be your turning point location. Install a wedge bolt anchor at each this location.

<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Levels/4 Levels turning point.png">
</p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>

**5 and 6** 
Set up the surveyor’s level on solid ground. Level the instrument. Start shooting elevations starting with RM 1 making sure that level is in focus and that surveyors rod is also level and stable. Record elevation and input data into SVQmax. Shoot elevations for remaining RM locations and RP locations. Record and enter data.

<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Levels/7 Levels Shoot Water Mark.png">
</p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shoot elevation at your turning point location. Do not move surveyors rod. Record and enter data. Adjust surveyors’ level up, stabilize and instrument. Shoot turning point again at new height, record and enter elevation data. Check elevation error.  If the error is outside of allowable tolerances redo turning point.

**8**
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Levels/8 Levels Shoot Turning Point.png">
</p>  
<br>
<br>
<br>
If the error is within allowable tolerances continue with all elevations at the new level height. Record and input data, checking elevation error as you go. Redo locations if necessary. Always end with RM 1. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Selecting a transect Site 

Transect site should be in a free flowing run, straight with uniform unobstructed flow.
There should not be any side channels, so that all the water flows through the main channel. 
Avoid pools, do not select areas where there is excess woody debris or large boulders. These characteristics can disturb flow creating turbulence, eddies and slack water. Be conscious of how the flow is affected by tributaries and if you want to include tributary discharge in your measurement. 

#### Stream Channel Reference Sites
The purpose of this section is to establish a permanent, benchmark reference site.



#### Recording Discharge Measurements


1. Note time and take River temperture
2. Log weather conditions; Sunny or cloudy, Air temp, Wind speed and Wind direction
3. Tighten a measuring tape across the stream at right angles to the flow. It should be taut and not sag in the          middle.
4. Take starting tape down measurement. ( this must be coinside with data logger collection interval, ie. every 15 min
   from the hour)
5. Measure the total stream width and record this measurement. 
6. Divide the width by 25, Round down value. Transect measurements cannot be complete at a interval less than .20ft in    distance across the stream. Measurements must be in at least .20 ft of water as well.
7. Turn on Flowtracker ADV and make sure that battery power is sufficent to complete transect.
8. Place ADV in stream and do self test. ( Rod held vertical, Meter directed into flow) at first measuring point.
   Always stand downstream of tape and measurement.
9. Determine mesurement direction LEW/REW   
10. Begin at starting edge. No measurement.
11.Take first measurement. Use a correction factor if neccessary. At depths under 1.5 ft we will take the V
   measurement at .6 depth, deeper than 1.5 ft two  Velocity  measurement will be taken at .2 and .8 of depth
   [(Discharge Measurement Heights.xlsx)](https://github.com/tdube2014/Discharge/blob/master/Data/Discharge%20Measure
   ment%20Heights.xlsx). Follow instructions on ADV and complete transect. 
12.End section.
13. Take endin tape down measurement. ( this must be coinside with data logger collection interval, ie. every 15          min from the hour)
14. QA/QC on Flowtracker ADV. Repeat or add sections as neccessary.
15. Download data to laptop and inspect on flowtracker software.
16. Retake if neccessary.


## **Flow Cam Discharge Data collection** <a name="paragraph3"></a>



####  Flow Cam Introduction
<img src="./Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/119876C_1.jpg" width="150" height=auto />



We are exploring the usefulness of digital photos as a affordable method of assessing stream flow.  In streams where we have generated a accurate stage discharge relationship we can create a digital library of staff gauge height that can be used to accurately calculate flow. Cameras that range from $70 could be a useful method of data collection in contrast to $300 dollar and up level loggers.  Thus allowing form collection of data in more stream locations.



#### Methods

+ Establish a location for discharge data collection as described in Discharge Data Collection SOPs

+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of satff gauge height.

+ Generate a staff discharge rating curve

+ Collect digital Photos 

## **Flow Cam: Time Lapse Discharge Data Collection** <a name="paragraph4"></a>

#### Time lapse Introduction

With the advances in machine learning we are exploring the possibilities of using time lapse photos to calculate flow levels. Time lapse photos may be a cost effective way to collect stream flow data. Not only could this be a usefully tool for scientists this may be a great way for citizen scientists to become involved with the collection of stream flow data and advance the knowledge of our watersheds.

#### objectives

Investigate the number and quality of photos needed to make it possible teach a cpu (train an algorithm) to calculate flow from a series of photos
 
Examining low cost camera options for digital photo collection
Game Cameras
Cell Phone Cameras
Raspberry Pi Zero v1.3 camera

### Flow Cams <a name="subparagraph21"></a>



#### Flow Cam Introduction

We are exploring the usefulness of digital photos as a affordable method of assessing stream flow.  In streams where we have generated a accurate stage discharge relationship we can create a digital library of staff gauge height that can be used to accurately calculate flow. Cameras that range from $70 could be a useful method of data collection in contrast to $300 dollar and up level loggers.  Thus allowing form collection of data in more stream locations.

#### Methods

+ Establish a location for discharge data collection as described in Discharge Data Collection SOPs

+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of satff gauge height.

+ Generate a staff discharge rating curve

+ Collect digital Photos
